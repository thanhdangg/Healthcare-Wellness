# Healthcare wellness

This is my new flutter project, in which I used the knowledge I learned to build simple layouts and practice state manaegement,... I have used below libraries in the project: 
- shared_preferences: used to save simple data to the phone. Specifically, in this project I  use it to save the first time user start app. 
- auto_route: it's a navigation package, it allows for strongly-typed arguments passing, effortless deep-linking and it uses code generation to simplify routes setup
- flutter_bloc: helps manage the state of the application using BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern. It separates the business logic from the user interface, making the application easier to maintain, test and extend. 
- dio: a powerful HTTP networking package, supports features like sending HTTP requests, timeout handling, and easy token management.
- freezed: is a library that helps create data classes concisely and implements the necessary methods for a class, making coding easier.
- get_it: is a tool that helps you manage dependencies in Flutter applications effectively, allows you to easily create and manage objects in your application, making your code clearer, easier to maintain, and easier to test
